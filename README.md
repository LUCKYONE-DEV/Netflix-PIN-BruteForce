# Netflix-PIN-BruteForce
 A program that cracks the account PIN of a Netflix profile.


A program written in C# with the .NET 5 framework.

You can easily open it in VS.

Optionally, an exe file is included, which you can execute immediately. 


After that, if you press the "BruteForce" button, you have to go to the first digit of the Netflix PIN entry immediately. The program will then go through all possibilities between 0 and 9999. You have to stay in this window for the time of the BruteForce... Don't click anywhere else.
